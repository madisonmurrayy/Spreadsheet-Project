Spreadsheet GUI using Blazor, HTML, CSS and Java runs from the GUI csproj. Spradsheet cell data is backed by the 
DependencyGraph data structure created in the DependencyGraph.cs file. Cell contents are handled and calcluated
in the Formula.cs class. All of the logic from DependencyGraph and Formula are brought together in the Spreadsheet
file. (The solution in a whole is also titled Spreadsheet).
